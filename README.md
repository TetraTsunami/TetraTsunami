## Heya! 
I'm Tsuni, a 20 year old developer from Wisconsin, USA, currently studying Computer Science at UW-Madison. When I'm not programming, you'll find me hiking, mountain biking, reading, tinkering with my old-PC-turned-server, or playing video games. I'm always looking out for new projects that excite me, so feel free to reach out!

<h3 align="center">What am I up to now?</h3>
